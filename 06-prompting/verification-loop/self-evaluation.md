# Self-Evaluation for Subjective Criteria

Review the component you just implemented:

1. Does it follow the architectural patterns in AGENTS.md?
2. Is the code readable to someone unfamiliar with the codebase?
3. Are the function and variable names clear and consistent?
4. Does the documentation explain the "why" not just the "what"?

For each criterion, answer YES or NO with a brief justification.
If any answer is NO, improve that aspect before proceeding.
