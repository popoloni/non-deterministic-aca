# Refactoring - Reverse Prompting Template

Before refactoring, confirm your understanding:
1. What is the goal of this refactoring (readability, performance,
   maintainability)?
2. What is the scope boundary---which files/modules are in scope?
3. Should behavior remain identical, or are minor changes acceptable?
4. What tests currently cover this code?
5. Are there dependent systems that might be affected?
