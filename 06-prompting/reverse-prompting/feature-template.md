# Feature Implementation - Reverse Prompting Template

Before implementing this feature, confirm your understanding:
1. What user action triggers this feature?
2. What data inputs are required, and what validation rules apply?
3. What should happen if the operation fails?
4. Are there performance requirements (response time, throughput)?
5. What existing patterns in the codebase should this follow?

Answer based on the specification. If any answer is unclear,
note the assumption you're making and proceed.
