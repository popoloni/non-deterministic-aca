# 06 - Advanced Prompting for Autonomous Systems

> 📖 **Book Reference:** Chapter 8

## Overview

The difference between a prompt that works in an interactive session and one that works in an autonomous loop is the difference between giving directions to a colleague who can ask follow-up questions and leaving instructions for someone who will execute them while you sleep.

## Techniques

### Reverse Prompting
Invert the pattern: AI questions you about requirements before executing.

### Constraint Cascades
Layer instructions across multiple passes, each building on verified output.

### Role Stacking
Evaluate from multiple expert viewpoints simultaneously to surface trade-offs.

### Verification Loop
Write, critique, rewrite — catch errors before they reach quality gates.
