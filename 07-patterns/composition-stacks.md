# Pattern Composition Stacks

## The Solo Developer Stack (Stage 5-6)
- Plan-Then-Execute
- Immutable Contract
- CI-as-Backpressure
- Compounding Engineering

**Workflow:** Generate plan → Lock as contract → Ralph Loop → CI validation → Codify learnings → Repeat

## The Overnight Factory (Stage 6-7)
- Background Agent CI
- Compounding Engineering
- Trust Calibration
- Drift Detection
- Blast Radius Containment

**Workflow:** Nightly compound review + build → Sandbox execution → Feature branches + CI → Weekly drift check

## The Migration Swarm (Stage 7-8)
- Swarm Migration
- Subagent Spawning
- Regression Safety Net
- Immutable Contract
- PII Scrubbing

**Workflow:** Create task list (immutable) → Spawn agent swarm → Each handles independent chunks → Full test suite per chunk → Human review of aggregate
