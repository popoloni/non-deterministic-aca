# Pattern Selection Guide

## By Scenario

| Scenario | Start With | Add Later |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| First Ralph Loop | Plan-Then-Execute, File-System as State | Compounding Engineering |
| Overnight execution | Background Agent CI, Blast Radius Containment | Drift Detection, Trust Calibration |
| Large migration | Swarm Migration, Regression Safety Net | Subagent Spawning, Tool Call Budget |
| Multi-developer team | Immutable Contract, Human-in-the-Loop Escalation | Inference-Healed Code Review |
| Security-sensitive code | Blast Radius Containment, PII Scrubbing | Secret Rotation, Audit Logging |
| Persistent quality issues | Deterministic Failure Harness, Regression Safety Net | Agent RFT (advanced) |

## Rule of Thumb

> Start with the minimum viable set for your scenario. Add patterns one at a time when you encounter the specific problem they solve.
